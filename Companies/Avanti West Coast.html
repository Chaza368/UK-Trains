			<h2 color="black"><b><u>History</u></b></h2>
			<p color="black">Avanti West Coast is a British train operating company owned by FirstGroup (70%) and Trenitalia (30%) that operates the West Coast Partnership.
				The company took over Virgin Trains, which had run WCP since 1997. WCP was scheduled to run until March 2030 and was supposed to operate the initial HS2 services
				after 2026 (though HS2 was later delayed). Then, due to the abolition of the franchise system, Trenitalia and the DfT planned to terminate the WCP franchise in March 
				2026.</p>
